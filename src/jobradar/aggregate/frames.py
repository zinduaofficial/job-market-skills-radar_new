"""Tidy frames built from the raw store.

Two rules from PLAN.md are enforced here rather than left to the notebooks,
because both are easy to forget and expensive to get wrong:

**Rule 1 — share, never raw counts.** Corpus size differs wildly between years,
segments and sources. Python's raw count triples between 2024 and 2026 mostly
because we hold three times as many 2026 postings. Every metric is
``pct_share`` — the fraction of postings *in that cell* mentioning the skill.

**Rule 2 — thin cells are suppressed.** A cell built on fewer postings than
``analysis.min_cell_size`` gets ``usable = False``. Downstream code filters on
that flag rather than re-deriving the rule, so a trend can never quietly rest on
nine postings.

A third rule applies only to time series: **ATS boards are excluded from the
monthly and yearly frames.** They carry real publish dates, but a 2024 posting
still open in 2026 is an evergreen or hard-to-fill role, so their history
measures recruiting difficulty rather than demand. Only sources listed in
``analysis.unbiased_history_sources`` feed a trend.

    The denominator choice is not cosmetic — it decides whether the global and

    Measured on the real corpus: **80.3% of global postings mention a technical
    skill, against 27.2% of Kenyan ones.** That is not a skills gap. The global
    corpus is ATS boards belonging to technology companies, so nearly every
    posting is a tech role; Kenyan job boards carry every sector, so most
    postings are nursing, driving, sales and teaching. Dividing by *all*
    postings therefore dilutes every Kenyan tech skill by roughly 3x and
    manufactures a diffusion gap out of corpus composition alone.

    So three shares are produced:

    ``pct_of_all``
        Fraction of every posting in the cell. Honest for "how much of this
        market wants X", useless for comparing two differently-composed markets.
    ``pct_of_tech``
        Fraction of postings that mention at least one taxonomy skill. This is
        the comparable one, and what the diffusion engine uses.
    ``share_of_mentions``
        Fraction of all skill mentions in the cell. Also normalises for how
        *specifically* a market writes its ads — Kenyan tech postings name fewer
        technologies each, which is a finding in its own right.
